# Skills Index

This is the runtime-shipped skills index for stage entrypoints.
Entrypoints select discretionary skills from this index; they do not infer runtime behavior from arbitrary skill metadata.
Stage-core skills are runtime-assigned by entrypoints or `required_skill_paths`, not selected as discretionary add-ons.
Shipped skills use the hybrid contract with thin manifest frontmatter for identity and structured markdown bodies for the actual guidance.

Usage contract:
- open this index before selecting discretionary skills
- prefer `required_skill_paths` supplied by the runtime when present
- if no fixed required skills are supplied, choose up to three relevant non-core skills
- avoid loading irrelevant skills
- do not claim an optional skill is available unless it is installed locally or listed in the supported downloadable skills directory
- Learning Analyst may refresh the remote directory into `remote_skills_index.md`
  and install relevant listed skills before loading them

## Stage-Core Skills

These skills are listed for package inventory and auditability. They are not a
general-purpose skill menu; use them only when the runtime or the stage
entrypoint explicitly assigns them.

## Shared Runtime Skills

| Skill | Description | Tags | Path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `millrace-skill-creator` | Shipped package for authoring new skill assets in the same hybrid format used by runtime skills. | `documentation`, `authoring` | `skills/millrace-skill-creator/SKILL.md` | shipped |

| `skills-readme` | Runtime skill-pack rules and constraints. | `documentation`, `runtime` | `skills/README.md` | shipped |

## Supported Downloadable Skills

Optional non-core skills live outside the Millrace runtime package. The supported
downloadable skills directory is:
`https://github.com/tim-osterhus/millrace-skills/blob/main/index.md`

Use `millrace skills refresh-remote-index` to cache that public index at
`millrace-agents/skills/remote_skills_index.md`, then
`millrace skills install <skill_id>` to install an available remote skill into a
workspace. Once installed, rely on the workspace-local `skills_index.md` and the
installed `SKILL.md` files as the source of availability truth.
